COMP 307 project
Abstraction of fantasy sports

This website brings the fantasy football format to everything. Users can create their own games with custom rules for scoring and win conditions. Examples include, fantasy elections, fantasy supreme court decisions, fantasy award shows, and fantasy celebrity death pools to name a few. 
The website will provide some curated games, likely for the elections campaign format. In this example, users will draft events based on polls:
- Party/candidate having the biggest gain in polls
- Party/candidate having the biggest loss in polls
- Leading party/candidate at end of week
- Trailing party/candidate at end of week
- Pick one region and one party and gain points based on the party's performance in that region
